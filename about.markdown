# A bit about me
My name is Pablo Mart√≠n Calvo, and this website is intended to serve the purpose of showcasing projects that I have worked on in the past.

I am a former teacher and instructional designer with over 8 years of experience in this domain before transitioning to a career into Data Engineering. In my last experiences as instructional designer I started working with data at IIEP-UNESCO on [Education Sector Plans](https://policytoolbox.iiep.unesco.org/glossary/education-sector-plan-esp/). That helped me decide I wanted to improve my technical skills, and therefore I pursued a training as a Data Analyst at [Wild Code School](https://www.wildcodeschool.com/) in Paris.

After 10 months as Data Analyst at [Delta - SamuSocial de Paris](https://www.samusocial.paris/delta-gestion-de-loffre-hoteliere-vocation-sociale-en-idf), I realized I was more interested in the data engineering part of the job, and therefore I decided to pursue a training as a Data Engineer at, again, [Wild Code School](https://www.wildcodeschool.com/).

Since the beginning of that Data Analytics training, I have been working on a variety of projects that showcase my skills in data pipelines, ETL processes, and database management. This portfolio tries to show how I have evolved as a data professional and, especially, what I am capable of doing nowadays.

My tech stack includes Python, SQL, Docker, Airflow, Kafka, Kubernetes, Terraform, AWS, GCP, Dataiku, and more, with varying levels of proficiency.  

Explore my projects to see how I turn raw data into actionable insights and infrastructure!
