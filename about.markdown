# A bit about me
I'm Pablo Martín Calvo, and this website showcases the projects I’ve worked on in the past.

I transitioned from over 8 years as a teacher and instructional designer into data engineering. My interest in data began during my work at [IIEP-UNESCO](https://www.iiep.unesco.org/en/) on [Education Sector Plans](https://policytoolbox.iiep.unesco.org/glossary/education-sector-plan-esp/)  where I realized the impact of data-driven decisions. This motivated me to enhance my technical skills, leading me to complete a Data Analyst program at [Wild Code School](https://www.wildcodeschool.com/) in Paris.

After 10 months as Data Analyst at [Delta - SamuSocial de Paris](https://www.samusocial.paris/delta-gestion-de-loffre-hoteliere-vocation-sociale-en-idf), I discovered a passion for data engineering. I returned to [Wild Code School](https://www.wildcodeschool.com/) to train specifically in Data Engineering.

Since then, I've developed strong skills in data pipelines, ETL processes, and database management. This portfolio reflects how I have evolved as a data professional and highlights the skills I bring to the table today.

## My tech stack
Python, SQL, Docker, Airflow, Kafka, Kubernetes, Terraform, AWS, GCP, Dataiku, and more.
